## jupyter
jupyter notebooks are fun

`jupyter notebook` to run
remember it's `shift + enter` to execute a cell not just enter

run this notebook anywhere with these two commands in your `.zshrc`
- export PATH="/Users/{user}/Library/Python/{version}/bin:$PATH"
- alias notebook="cd ~/{path}/jupyter; jupyter notebook"
